# The-weighted-coins
You have 12 identical-looking coins, but one of them is slightly lighter than the others. You also have a balance scale. Using the scale only three times, can you identify the lighter coin and determine if it is lighter or heavier than the rest?

Solution 2: Here's how you can identify the lighter coin and determine if it is lighter or heavier:

Divide the 12 coins into three groups of four coins each (A, B, C).

Weigh group A against group B:

If they balance, the lighter coin is in group C. Go to step 3.
If they don't balance, proceed to step 3.
Take the lighter group (A or B) and weigh two of the coins against each other.

If they balance, the remaining coin in that group is the lighter one.
If they don't balance, the lighter coin is the one that is lighter in the second weighing.
By using the balance scale only three times, you can identify the lighter coin and determine if it is lighter or heavier than the rest.
